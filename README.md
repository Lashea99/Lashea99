Hi, My name is Kiah DaViega and this summer I am participating in an REU at University of Wisconsin River Falls

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Physics #ClassOf2021

I am super interested in astrophysics! One day I hope to study about black holes or dark matter

Also.... I have a dog named Entropy🐕
